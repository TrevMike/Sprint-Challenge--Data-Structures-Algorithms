<!-- eggs method -->
while just like any other science experiment the first thing i would do is find out how
many floors the build is (n)stories, then I would start on the first floor and see if it cracks
then if it doesn't crack, move on to the second floor etc. I would repeat the process intill I found
what floor the egg would start breaking. you can also start from the highest floor and go down. you can also start in the middle
and if it cracks go down a floor and if it doesn't go up a floor. there are 3 different ways of tackling this.
